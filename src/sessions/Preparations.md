## Standard Hardware

Knurling Sessions 2020 Q4 assumes you're using the [nRF52840 Development Kit (DK)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK) as your development board. You can also use any other board supported by [`probe-run`](https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run), but you may have to make some modifications to the provided instructions on your own.

The DK needs to be connected to your PC with *1* micro-USB cables (make sure they're data cables and not just for charging). The chapter on [checking your hardware](./hardware.md) will provide you with more details.

You'll need a few more peripherals and parts - all in all:
