# Knurling Sessions 2020 Q4: Building a CO<sub>2</sub> Sensor
![all the hardware needed for this project](../img/hardware.jpg)

In the first Knurling-sessions project, we will be incrementally building a CO<sub>2</sub> sensor. This is not only a fun way to explore working with electronics and embedded Rust, in the end you'll also have a useful helper, especially if you're working from home: CO<sub>2</sub> levels have a significant impact on your ability to concentrate and make decisions, and they drop faster than you think! The device we're building will tell you when it's time to open a window.

The first month is about learning some basics of embedded development and Rust. The SCD30 Sensor will be implemented in the second month. The third month is about embedded graphics and display.
