# Knurling Session 2020 Q4

This repo contains the source for the first knurling session as well as the example code.

## About
This course will cover building a CO2 measuring device. We will show how to start an embedded program from scratch, how to write a driver for the sensor, and how to read the sensor output in a terminal. We will build a visual indicator for air quality and an acoustic alarm. In the last part, we will add an ePaper display to the setup and talk bit about the embedded-graphics crate.

## Read it
You can access a rendered version at
> [**session20q4.ferrous-systems.com**](https://session20q4.ferrous-systems.com)

To build from source just run *(assuming you have `mdbook` [installed])*:
``` console
$ mdbook serve
```

## Example code
Example code can be found in [`code/`](./code/).
