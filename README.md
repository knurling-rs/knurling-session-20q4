# Knurling Session 2020 Q4

This repo contains the source for the first knurling session.

## About
This course will cover building a CO2 measuring device. We will show how to start an embedded program from scratch, how to write a driver for the sensor, and how to read the sensor output in a terminal. We will build a visual indicator for air quality and an acoustic alarm. In the last part, we will add an ePaper display to the setup and talk bit about the embedded-graphics crate.

## Read it
You can access a rendered version at

$ mdbook serve
```
